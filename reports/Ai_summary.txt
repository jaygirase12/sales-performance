📊 Sales Dashboard Insights

Strong Overall Sales – The company achieved $2.3M in total sales, with $0.3M profit, showing positive but modest profitability.

Profit Margin Challenge – At just 12.5%, profit margin is relatively low. Discounts (avg. 15.6%) may be eroding profitability → need to review pricing/discount strategy.

Growth Opportunity – Sales are showing +3.8% Month-over-Month growth, signaling upward momentum that can be capitalized on by scaling high-performing regions/products.

Category Insights – Technology leads sales (~$0.8M), while Furniture and Office Supplies are similar but lower. More focus on cross-selling/up-selling in weaker categories could balance growth.

Customer Concentration Risk – Top 10 customers contribute significantly to sales; heavy reliance on a few customers could be risky. Opportunity exists to expand customer base and reduce dependency.
